# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD-USING-POWER-BI

The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle, containing dummy HR data. The dataset included information about employees, such as education, age, salary, job role, years at the company, and attrition status.

# ETL Process:
1.	Extraction: The data was extracted from the Kaggle dataset into Power BI for further analysis.
2.	Transformation: Data transformation involved cleaning, handling missing values, and formatting the data for better analysis.
3.	Loading: The transformed data was loaded into Power BI for creating visualizations.

# Data Cleaning:
•	Identified and handled missing values to ensure accurate analysis.
•	Removed duplicate data entries to maintain data integrity.
•	Standardized data formats for consistency in reporting.

# Visualizations: The dashboard featured several key visualizations:
1.	Attrition by Education: A bar chart illustrating the distribution of attrition based on education level.
2.	Attrition by Age: A line chart displaying attrition trends across different age groups.
3.	Attrition by Salary Slab: A stacked bar chart presenting attrition rates within salary slabs.
4.	Attrition by Job Role: A pie chart depicting attrition percentages based on job roles.
5.	Attrition by Years at Company and Job Role: A scatter plot highlighting attrition patterns concerning both tenure and job roles.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1.	Count of Employees: The total number of employees in the dataset.
2.	Attrition: The count of employees who have left the company.
3.	Attrition Rate: The percentage of employees who have left, calculated as (Attrition / Total Employees) * 100.
4.	Average Age: The mean age of the employees.
5.	Average Salary: The mean salary of the employees.
6.	Average Years at Company: The average number of years employees have been with the company.

# Slicers: Slicers were implemented for gender and department, enabling dynamic filtering of data for more targeted analysis.
Insights:
1.	Employees with lower education levels tend to have higher attrition rates.
2.	Attrition is more prevalent among younger employees.
3.	Attrition rates are higher in certain salary slabs, suggesting a correlation between salary and employee retention.
4.	Job roles significantly influence attrition, with some roles experiencing higher turnover.
5.	Employees with fewer years at the company are more likely to leave.
